This project is an analysis of a dataset of detailed weather records from New Dehli, India, starting in November 1996 and ending in April 2014. This dataset was chosen because of its size and detail, featuring over one hundred thousand entries and over twenty different fields. These data can be used to perform a variety of analyses linking different attributes, for example finding what times of the year are more prone to smog, or if wind direction can be a good indicator for presence of precipitation. 

Before being able to conduct any effective data analysis, as with any other skilled project, the right tools have to be selected. This project will be using the library TidyVerse because of its extensive data organization and the library GGPlot because of its consice and dynamic visualization options.
```{R}
library("tidyverse")
library("ggplot2")
```

In order to read and modify the dataset, it first has to be read into this workspace, done here via local filepath. This data is sourced from user mahirkukreja who posted it to kaggle.com on the page https://www.kaggle.com/mahirkukreja/delhi-weather-data/. 
```{R}
weather <- read.csv(file="~/Documentos/Escuela/19fa/DSCI_385/P01/dehliweather.csv",)
```

 [1] "datetime_utc" "X_conds"      "X_dewptm"    
 [4] "X_fog"        "X_hail"       "X_heatindexm"
 [7] "X_hum"        "X_precipm"    "X_pressurem" 
[10] "X_rain"       "X_snow"       "X_tempm"     
[13] "X_thunder"    "X_tornado"    "X_vism"      
[16] "X_wdird"      "X_wdire"      "X_wgustm"    
[19] "X_windchillm" "X_wspdm"     

The initial column labels of the dataset were copied and pasted here from a terminal output. If the terminal output was shown instead, they could be updated as the dataset is changed. This shows that the original label format is strange and confusing at times, and uses strange or arbitrary notations and abbreviations. In order to help make the dataset tidy and readable, some of these names will be changed to be more clear:
```{R}
colnames(weather)[colnames(weather)=="datetime_utc"]<-"datetime_utc"
colnames(weather)[colnames(weather)=="X_conds"]<-"air_condition"
colnames(weather)[colnames(weather)=="X_dewptm"]<-"dew_point"
colnames(weather)[colnames(weather)=="X_fog"]<-"any_fog"
colnames(weather)[colnames(weather)=="X_hail"]<-"any_hail"
colnames(weather)[colnames(weather)=="X_heatindexm"]<-"heat_index"
colnames(weather)[colnames(weather)=="X_hum"]<-"humidity"
colnames(weather)[colnames(weather)=="X_precipm"]<-"precipitation"
colnames(weather)[colnames(weather)=="X_pressurem"]<-"air_pressure"
colnames(weather)[colnames(weather)=="X_rain"]<-"any_rain"
colnames(weather)[colnames(weather)=="X_snow"]<-"any_snow"
colnames(weather)[colnames(weather)=="X_tempm"]<-"temperature"
colnames(weather)[colnames(weather)=="X_thunder"]<-"any_thunder"
colnames(weather)[colnames(weather)=="X_tornado"]<-"any_tornadoes"
colnames(weather)[colnames(weather)=="X_vism"]<-"visibility"
colnames(weather)[colnames(weather)=="X_wdird"]<-"wind_angle"
colnames(weather)[colnames(weather)=="X_wdire"]<-"wind_direction"
colnames(weather)[colnames(weather)=="X_wgustm"]<-"wind_gust_speed"
colnames(weather)[colnames(weather)=="X_windchillm"]<-"wind_chill"
colnames(weather)[colnames(weather)=="X_wspdm"]<-"wind_average_speed"
head(weather, n =5)
```

These data labels make the data easier to analyze by clearly describing what they represent. It requires no experience with data sience to understand what each of these values is generally trying to say. Specifics on each field will be explained below, which will give us an idea what fields warrant further changes:

datetime_utc
  This is simply the date and time of day using the Coordinated Universal Time system. It is continuous and should be changed to the date format built into R.
  
air_condition
  This field contains the primary air condition at the time of the reading. It is a categorical form variable that can take one of many different types of values. Here are the first ten encountered in the list:
 [2] Clear                        
 [3] Haze                         
 [4] Unknown                      
 [5] Scattered Clouds             
 [6] Shallow Fog                  
 [7] Mostly Cloudy                
 [8] Fog                          
 [9] Partly Cloudy                
[10] Patches of Fog               

dew_point
  This is the dew point at the current time, which is the temperature at which dew will form, given the current temperature and pressure conditions. It is a decimal with one point of precision.
  
any_fog
  This attribute represents whether or not there currently is fog, represented as a boolean value.
  
any_hail
  This is a boolean attribute representing if there currently is hail. There are no data points during which it was hailing, making this a prime candidate for removal.
  
heat_index
  This is a continuous number variable representing the current heat index, which takes into account humidity to more accurately represent percieved temperature.

humidity
  This is a continuous decimal number variable that represents the current humidity.
  
precipitiaton
  All entries for this value contain missing entries, making it a prime candidate for removal.
  
air_pressure
  This value represents air pressure. The values are all around 1000, which isn't in a reasonable range for any of the most common units, but this variable could still be kept around to compare relative air pressure within the dataset. 
  
any_rain
  A boolean value expressing the presence of rain.
  
any_snow
  A boolean value expressing the presence of snow. Only true for one single reading in May of 2014. Being virtually empty makes it a candidate for removal.
  
temperature
  A decimal number representing the current temperature in centigrade.

any_thunder
  A boolean value expressing the presence of thunder.
  
any_tornadoes
  A boolean value expressing the presence of tornadoes. Only true for two entries, one during August of 1999, and one during February of 2007. Curiously, snow is less common in New Delhi than tornadoes. Because this is mostly empty, it is a candidate for deletion.
  
visibility
  A decimal number representing the current visibility, in km.
  
wind_angle
  An integer representing the degrees to the right of north that the wind is blowing.

wind_direction
  A string representing the direction of the wind in 3-letter cardinal direction combinations.
  
wind_gust_speed
  A decimal representing the max speed in km/hr that the wind is blowing in periods of fluctuation.
  
wind_chill
  An integer representing the apparent temperature due to the speed of the wind in centigrade.
  
wind_average_speed
  A decimal representing the current average speed that the wind is going.
  


Now that we have looked at our data, we can begin to modify it and clean it up.
```{R}
weather <- subset(weather, select = -c(any_snow, any_hail, any_tornadoes, precipitation))
```

For the first deliverable, you will set up your portfolio so that you can publish your work continuously as you make progress. Getting Started (below) will give you directions for doing so. 

Your first deliverable will concentrate on the Discovery and Data Preparation phases in the Data Analytics Life Cycle (see week 1 reading to review). In your R Notebook, you should document your process and provide R code for importing and cleaning your data as well as performing some initial investigation and demonstrating familiarity with the data.

In an Introduction, describe your motivation for choosing the general topic of your portfolio.
Identify your initial data set that you will be using. The data set should have at least:
at least 1000 observations
at least 10 variables
...of which at least 3 are categorical
...and at least 7 are continuous
Describe your source, using critical analysis to assess the quality (and possible limitations) of it
Document your variables and describe in plain language what they mean and how they are represented
Document any manipulations you make to clean your data and organize it as Tidy Data as best you can prepare it for data analysis and modeling
Summarize your data using descriptive statistics, along with visualizations (with accompanying interpretations) that help explore what possible insights you might investigate.
Finally, describe what research questions you hope to explore in later phases, along with potential social & ethical implications of your work. For help identifying and phrasing research questions, see How to Write a Research Question

This product is the final entry in the New Delhi weather and air quality analysis project that has been continuing throughout this course. In this project I will be walking through making some detailed changes in the previous projects based on feedback I received on the previous projects and also my own intuition. This report will include an analysis of a cross-validation done on the project and how effective it is at answering the research questions. In additon, I will be explaining how the findings from this project could be operationalized, and weigh the benefits and ramifications of doing so. 

Just like always, we have to select the correct tools for the operation. These are the same packages as used in P02. 
```{R, results='hide', message=FALSE}
  include <- function(library_name){
    if( !(library_name %in% installed.packages()) )
      install.packages(library_name) 
    library(library_name, character.only=TRUE)
  }
include("tidyverse")
#include("caret")
#include("dplyr")
#include("knitr")
#include("tidyr")
```

The first part of this assignment is the edits of the first and second parts of the project. 

Once again, we begin where we left off by passing in all of the data from P02 with all of the changes made to it from the previous deliverables. This ensures that no redundant work needs to be done to organize the data. 
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, error=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
purl("P02.Rmd", output = "P02.r") # produces r source from rmd
source("P02.r") # executes the source
```
